Instruction of the lizard simulation

1. File description
1) RunLizard.m: Main code of the lizard simulation
2) A1Mat.m ~ A15Mat.m: The kinetic energy matrix of the lizard model in joint space
3) B3Mat.m ~ B32Mat.m: The vector of centrifugal and Coriolis forces of the lizard model in joint space (1)
4) C1_5Mat.m ~ C31_33Mat.m: The vector of centrifugal and Coriolis forces of the lizard model in joint space (2)
5) COM.m: Calculation for the center of mass of the lizard model
6) COMIn.m: Calculation for the initial position of the COM (Not used)
7) COMNq.m: Calculation for virtual joint X, Y
8) ConDynEquAndVirJForHind.m: Joint torque calculation by inverse dynamics when the lizard model touches on the ground.
9) DynEquAndVirJ.m: Joint torque calculation by inverse dynamics when the lizard model does not touch on the ground.
10) gMat.m: The potential vector of the lizard model in joint space
11) PosJ.m: Positions of the joints of the lizard model

2. Main code file configuration
1) Design Variable: The joint angle's amplitudes and the phases are determined
2) Simulation setting: PeriodTime, the number of iterations in one period, and repeat number of the simulation are set
3) Initial setting: The lizard model's mass, body length, width, height are determined. Also, the position of the shoulder and pelvic are determined. The virtual joint values are setup.
4) Failure Check Kinematics: This step calculates the joint position, and the lizard model's height is determined.
5) Forward-Backward Dynamics Simulation
 a) Calculation for the center of the mass of the lizard model at the initial state
 b) Checking the contact between the lizard model's foot and the ground
 c) Case 1: Left foot contact
  - Calculation for the joint torque, the joint's position, and the center of the mass of the lizard model
  - using 'ConDynEquAndVirJForHind.m'
 d) Case 2: Right foot contact
  - Calculation for the joint torque, the joint's position, and the center of the mass of the lizard model
  - using 'ConDynEquAndVirJForHind.m'
 e) Case 3: Non-contact
  - Calculation for the joint torque, the joint's position, and the center of the mass of the lizard model
  - using 'DynEquAndVirJ.m'
6) Animation: Showing the lizard model's locomotion using the saved joint positions.
